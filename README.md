This is my Pico Presentation, all is well. 

There were originally issues with the compiling and other such things due to the example pdf that remained within the overleaf page after i copied the template into a new document to work with coding. 

This was resolved,

Will upload .pdf to here as well as Cloudstor

I now realise the importance of github and commits
