Background: Dealing with Philosophical texts is confusing enough! Add a different language into the mix and there is almost a guarantee that something will be lost in translation. What is the remedy to this? Multiple Translations of course!

 \vspace{12pt}
 
Aims/Objectives: The aim was to be able to utilise the Unix Shell to be able to run an easy script to pull 5 iterations of a single translated word and show them up consecutively on the console. 

 \vspace{12pt}
 
Outcome: The outcome wasn't as glamorous, after returning to the drawing board and experimenting, creating a directory and shell scripts to pull translated chapters and consecutively displaying them was the compromise i completed.

      Significance: This tool provides low stress on the computer and no extra word documents, browsers or pdfs need to be loaded. Whilst you're working away if you need to see extra translations open up your shell and autofill the code and there you go! This makes the process of referring to multiple translations significantly easier.

     Example: The Image to the left shows an example of the script being utilised from the shell. As you can see two of the chapters are in the window. (Project Gutenburg 2015)

   Dao De Jing: This text is an ancient Chinese Philosophical text dating back thousands of years to a mysterious author named Laozi. It can be traced as far as 2500 years to a set of ancient bamboo scripts called the Guodian Wuxing. (Csikszentmihayli 2004)

	  The text is quite confusing and there are many translations, most of which are public domain or fair use.
